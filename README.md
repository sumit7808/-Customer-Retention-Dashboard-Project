Subject: Customer Retention Insights and Recommendations for PhoneNow

Hi [Engagement Partner's Name],

I’ve created a customer retention dashboard based on PhoneNow’s data. Key insights include:

Churn Rate: 26.54%

High Churn Segments: Fiber optic users, month-to-month contracts, customers without partners/dependents

Monthly Revenue Loss: $139,130.85

Recommendations:

Proactive Retention: Reach out to high-risk customers with personalized offers.

Contract Bundling: Encourage longer contracts with discounts.

Support Optimization: Streamline support processes to reduce ticket-related churn.

Happy to walk through the dashboard and discuss strategies to mitigate churn!

Best,Sumit Singh
